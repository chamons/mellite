# Mellite - A mass metadata conversion tool

Mellite is a tool for making large scale changes of metadata on C# source code bases.

## Name

[Meta](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_(mythology)>) was the daughter of Hoples who became the first wife of Aegeus, king of Athens. Some traditions however name her as Mellite.

It seemed fitting that a tool for mass renaming "Meta"-data is an alternate name for Meta.
